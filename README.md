# Sales Management System in C++

This project, developed as part of the Computer Science II (CS2) course, is a console-based application written in C++. The program enables users to manage and analyze sales data across multiple branches of a business over different quarters.

# Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need a compiler that can compile C++ code. This project was developed using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), but should work with any standard C++ compiler.

 # Prerequisites
C++ Compiler (GCC recommended)
Terminal/command-line interface
# Installing
Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone <repository-url>.
Navigate to the project directory.
Compile the project using your C++ compiler. 
 # Running the Program
Upon running the program, you will be prompted to enter sales data for each quarter for each branch. After the data has been entered, the system will calculate quarterly and branch sums, and display an annual sales report.
